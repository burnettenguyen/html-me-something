         <p>Hi, my name is Burnette Nguyen-Emerson. I previously lived in the Bay Area, CA. I was a city girl through and through. I enjoyed exploring different places, trying a variety of global cuisines, mingling with diversity, and took for granted the access to a lot of things literally at my fingertips. Then I met my husband in CA, fell in love, and we decided to move to his hometown: Nixa, MO. </p>

         <p>We got a "small" house in Nixa. (In my mind, it's big compared to the tiny rented CA apartments we previously resided in.) It was an initial culture shock to live in an area with a smaller population density, where neighbors know each other, and there is a big emphasis on community.</p>

         <p>My husband and I have since carved out a beautiful home for ourselves the last 5 years, along with creating a wonderful community. I enjoy gardening in our large backyard garden. We also became new beekeepers this year to a healthy colony. I enjoy personal development - specifically Human Design and energy work. I do personal Human Design readings for people to bring more clarity to their life's work and purpose.</p>

         <p>I'm not sure where or what I'll be doing after this course. I hope to be able to use my newfound knowledge and skills to create sacred online spaces to help people and improve the world in some capacity.</p>
